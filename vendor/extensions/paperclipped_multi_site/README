= paperclipped_multi_site

This extension scopes assets to sites. Our fork of multi-site is needed, and does all the work (by putting a scope around find, essentially), so there are no controller modifications required and we can shrink this to just a line.

You could get rid of this extension altogether by adding this to Asset:

  is_site_scoped if defined? Site && Radiant::Config['assets.scoped?']

But the conditionality does make your tests a bit tangled.

See http://wiki.github.com/spanner/radiant-multi-site-extension for an explanation of is_site_scoped

Some basic tests are included to make sure that Asset loads and is properly hooked up.
